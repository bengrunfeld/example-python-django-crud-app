## Python Django Example CRUD App for Deis

This app to adheres to the standards of the [Twelve-Factor](http://12factor.net/) app methodology.

The main aim of this app is to show potential PaaS users how to hook up a Django app to a 3rd-party database, such as [Amazon RDS](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/), then deploy it to a public cloud such as [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) using a PaaS, noteably [Deis](http://deis.io).

A future edition to this app will explore how to store static assets in [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
